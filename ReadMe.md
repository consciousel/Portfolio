# Portfolio
This repository provides a compiled list of my past completed projects that I have available for public view. 

Solana NFT Project - Solana Testnet:

This was my first NFT projects that I built on the Solana network with mostly JavaScript and no Rust or Solidity. The Dapp allows a user to mint a random NFT from a preselected collection of pictures that have been uploaded to Arweave. 



Palette NFT Minter - Polygon Mainnet:

With the hype in the NFT market and limited knowlege on how to make custom NFTs, I wanted to create a platform where anyone can have access to minting their own unique NFTs without paying exorbitant fees. This dapp allows anyone to mint an NFT on the Polygon network provided they already have the art file for their NFT. All minted NFTs can be traded on Open Sea and other NFT platforms.



Trading Bot - Ethereum Mainnet:

Created a Trading Bot contract that utilizes flashloans to execute arbitrage transactions between exchanges. When there is high volatility and high trading volumes within the crypto markets, it creates opportunities for arbitrage as price updates can lag between exchanges. This trading bot takes advantage of these price discrepancies by borrowing funds from a flashloan provider (DyDx), executing the trade, and paying back the loan within the same transaction.     



Exchange Platform - Kovan Ethereum Testnet:

Created a new ERC20 token along with an exchange platform to trade the token against Ether on the Ethereum Network.
